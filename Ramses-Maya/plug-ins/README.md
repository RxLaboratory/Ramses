# Modules

## dumaf

The Duduf Maya Framework contains useful methods to handle Maya.

## ramses_maya

This is the actual plug-in for maya

## yaml

The `yaml` module is the ***[PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)*** parser licensed under the MIT license.

It can be installed with `pip install pyyaml`, but it is included here to make it easier to distribute this Maya module with all dependencies.

## ramses

The [python module (API) for Ramses](https://github.com/RxLaboratory/Ramses-Py) is not included here, but it is needed to run the Maya plug-in. Just copy the `ramses` folder here. It will soon be added as a submodule.
